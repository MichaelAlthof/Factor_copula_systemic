Description:      'Construct a network plot from an adjacency matrix for a network of 28 systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). The plot is built using a force-directed Fruchterman-Reingold graph drawing algorithm. The binary adjacency matrix is constructed via a spacings-based approach applied to a Spearman rank correlation matrix'
